The work environment here at **Koodon Inc.**, located in the middle of Gangnam District in Seoul, was way better than I thought! Even though it is a small startup having 6-10 employees in total, my fellow interns and I received our seats and tools we need, such as monitors.

I was very surprised since the company wants us, four software engineer interns, to build an entire website and mobile app that would replace its current website. AND **THERE IS NO PROGRAMMER in this team at the moment!**

This week, I have had several meetings, on daily basis, with entire staffs and fellow interns to talk about product design and to set up the timeline for this project.

I was wondering why the company wants to build its own website although their service has been active almost for a year (and quite successful).

The current website and mobile apps of Koodon were created under an e-commerce website solution, but the company wants to step out of the platform because both the CEO and a UX/UI designer believe changing User Interface is necessary to bring their business to the next level.

In this sense, even if this could be a little challenging mission for an unexperienced software developer, building/planning the web program that will be live on market from the scratch, I think this would be an interesting and rewarding journey to start on.
