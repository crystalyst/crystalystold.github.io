To start using Python and Django Web Framework for my summer internship as a Back-end engineer, I am starting to learn Django with the official documentation.

This is the tutorial to make a simple project, which is called "mysite," contaning an application named polls and admin.

- The polls app lets user view polls and make votes
- The admin site enables user to modify and view the polls database.
