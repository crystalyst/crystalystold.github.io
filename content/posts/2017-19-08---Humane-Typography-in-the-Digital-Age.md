To start using Python and Django Web Framework for my summer internship as a Back-end engineer, I am starting to learn Django with the official documentation.

This is the tutorial to make a simple project, which is called "mysite," contaning an application named polls and admin.

- The polls app lets user view polls and make votes
- The admin site enables user to modify and view the polls database.

## Before starting the project

Assuming that Django is already installed in the current virtual directory, create the project with django.

```django-admin startproject mysite```

Then, you can see a project directory
