I am a rising senior majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science in Columbia University in the city of New York. Currently working on back-end skillsets, such as Django, Python, and Java, by conducting multiple individual/team projects.

*From Seoul, where I was born and raised, to New York City, NY, I have been exploring my interest in achieving social values by participating in non-profit projects based on sustainable development and human-centered design.*

I love to challenge myself, to learn new disciplines that I am not aware of (programming was definitely one of those things). I enjoy devoting my free time and energy to train Tae Kwon Do.
