Even though it is a small startup having 6-10 employees in total, my fellow interns and I received our seats and tools we need, such as monitors.</p>\n<p>I was very surprised since the company wants us, four software engineer student interns, to build an entire website and mobile app that would replace its current website. AND <strong>THERE IS NO PROGRAMMER in this team at the moment!</strong></p>\n<p>This week, I have had several meetings, on daily basis, with entire staffs and fellow interns to talk about product design and to set up the timeline for this project.</p>\n<p>I was wondering why the company wants to build its own website although their service has been active almost for a year (and quite successful).</p>\n<p>The current website and mobile apps of Koodon were created under an e-commerce website solution, but the company wants to step out of the platform because both the CEO and a UX/UI designer believe changing User Interface is necessary to bring their business to the next level.</p>\n<p>In this sense, even if this could be a little challenging mission for an unexperienced software developer, building/planning the web program that will be live on market from the scratch, I think this would be an interesting and rewarding journey to start on.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/summer-internship-2020","tagSlugs":["/tag/python/","/tag/django/","/tag/backend/","/tag/web-development/","/tag/internship/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2020-07-17T22:40:32.169Z","description":"A weekly log for my Software Engineering summer internship at Koodon - Week 1","tags":["Python","Django","Backend","Web Development","Internship"],"title":"Koodon - Internship Week 1 log","socialImage":"/media/42-line-bible.jpg"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/summer-internship-2020"}}}
